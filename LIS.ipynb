    "The first thing you need to create our virutal environment. Let's let VSCode do this for us. Click 'Select Kernel' in the upper right hand and do 'New Python Environment'. You can use a python enviornment. We can use PIP or Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use Aanaconda if you plan to do future research that involves informatics. It is a package manager with better support for ensuring your python package dependencies, ensuring they work more consistently; however, [PIP](#pip) is easier to use out of the box without additional installation.\n",

    "### PIP\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed Anaconda, skip this section. Otherwise we'll be using PIP. It's a bit easier at first but is more brittle and not as good a choice for research. We will need to set up a virtual environment.\n",

    "## Setting up the Virtual Enviornment\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best practice to set up a 'virtual environment' where python modules will be installed in an isolated space on your computer that we can eventually delete without affecting your computer in a larger scale. \n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
